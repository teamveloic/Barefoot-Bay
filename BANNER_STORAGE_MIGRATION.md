# Banner Slide Storage Migration

This document outlines the changes made to ensure all banner slides are EXCLUSIVELY stored in and served from Replit Object Storage, with absolutely NO filesystem storage or fallbacks.

## Overview

The banner slides in the Barefoot Bay community platform are now stored exclusively in Replit Object Storage in the dedicated `BANNER` bucket. This ensures persistence across deployments and container restarts.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Banner Storage Override

We created a specialized module `server/banner-storage-override.ts` that overrides key functions related to banner slide storage:

- `verifyBannerSlideExists`: Always returns true to bypass filesystem checking
- `syncBannerSlide`: Prevents filesystem syncing, only uses Object Storage
- Added helper functions for Object Storage operations specific to banner slides

### 2. Migration Script

A migration script `migrate-banner-slides.js` was created to move all existing banner slides from filesystem to Object Storage:

```bash
# Run this to migrate existing banner slides to Object Storage
node migrate-banner-slides.js
```

### 3. Modified Direct Upload Endpoint

The `/api/admin/direct-banner-upload` endpoint was modified to:

- Upload ONLY to Object Storage, never to filesystem
- Use the BANNER bucket for all banner slides
- Return clean Object Storage URLs for banner slides

### 4. Frontend Updates

The banner slide editor component has been updated to clearly display the source of media and prioritize Object Storage URLs.

## Key Files Modified

1. `server/banner-storage-override.ts` (NEW)
2. `server/routes.ts`
3. `client/src/components/home/banner-slide-editor.tsx`
4. `migrate-banner-slides.js` (NEW)

## Benefits

- **Persistence**: Banner slides remain available after container restarts and deployments
- **Simplified Storage**: Single source of truth for banner slides
- **Improved Performance**: Consistent loading from Object Storage
- **Reduced Errors**: No more "missing image" errors after deployments
- **Cleaner URLs**: Consistent URL structure for all banner slides

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Storage Bucket

All banner slides are stored in the `BANNER` bucket in Object Storage. This bucket is dedicated to banner slides only, improving organization and security.

### URL Structure

Banner slide URLs now follow this pattern:
```
https://object-storage.replit.app/BANNER/banner-slides/{filename}
```

### No Filesystem Fallback

The code has been modified to NEVER fall back to filesystem storage for banner slides. If an Object Storage operation fails, it will return an error rather than trying to use the filesystem.

## Troubleshooting

If banner slides are not appearing:

1. Make sure you've run the migration script to move existing slides to Object Storage
2. Check the server logs for any Object Storage errors
3. Verify the banner slide exists in the BANNER bucket with the correct path
