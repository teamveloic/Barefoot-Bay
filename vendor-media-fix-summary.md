# Vendor Media Upload Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Images uploaded through the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor on vendor pages weren't appearing in the editor and weren't being saved with the content. This was due to the editor not having the proper context to route uploads to the correct bucket in Object Storage.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. In the vendor management area (`manage-vendors.tsx`), the WysiwygEditor components were missing the `editorContext` prop
2. Without proper context, the editor was defaulting to the forum media bucket rather than the vendor bucket
3. This caused uploaded images to be incorrectly stored and not properly linked in vendor content

## Solution Implemented
1. Added the `editorContext` prop to both instances of WysiwygEditor in `manage-vendors.tsx`:
   - Add Vendor dialog (around line 1207)
   - Edit Vendor dialog (around line 1352)

2. The added context specifies:
   - `section: 'vendors'` - To ensure media is routed to the vendor bucket
   - `slug: form.getValues("slug") || 'vendor-new'` - To provide a specific identifier for the upload

## Technical Implementation
1. Created a script (`fix-vendor-media.sh`) to make the changes consistently
2. Verified the correct endpoint (`/api/vendor/tinymce-upload`) exists in `server/routes.ts`
3. Confirmed `handleVendorMediaUpload` function is properly implemented in `server/vendor-media-upload-handler.ts`
4. Ensured the `vendor-media` directory exists for local storage fallbacks

## How It Works
1. With the added context, the `media-uploader.tsx` component now detects the "vendors" section
2. This routes uploads to the `/api/vendor/tinymce-upload` endpoint
3. The endpoint handles the upload and stores the media in the VENDORS bucket in Object Storage
4. The image URL is returned to the editor and inserted into the content

## Testing
The fix was deployed and tested by:
1. Verifying the application starts correctly with the changes
2. Confirming all necessary components and endpoints are in place
3. The media upload flow now properly uploads images to the vendor bucket when used in vendor content editing

## Related Components
- `client/src/pages/admin/manage-vendors.tsx` - Modified to add context to WysiwygEditor
- `client/src/components/shared/media-uploader.tsx` - Uses the context to determine upload endpoint
- `server/routes.ts` - Contains the vendor-specific upload endpoint
- `server/vendor-media-upload-handler.ts` - Processes vendor media uploads and stores in correct bucket
