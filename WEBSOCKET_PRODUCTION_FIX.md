# WebSocket and Production Loading Fix

## Issue Fixed
This update resolves the critical Minified React Error #300 that was preventing the website from loading correctly in production. The issue was related to conflicts between banner media components and disabled WebSocket functionality in production mode.

## Root Cause
1. The WebSocket functionality was intentionally disabled in production to prevent conflicts with Replit Object Storage operations
2. However, banner components (especially BannerVideo) were still trying to access WebSocket methods like `websocketHelper.isConnected()`
3. This caused React to encounter errors during rendering, resulting in the app crashing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Error Boundary Component
- Added an `ErrorBoundary` component that catches JavaScript errors in child components
- Prevents the entire application from crashing when individual components fail
- Provides a user-friendly fallback UI with a refresh button

### 2. Fixed BannerVideo Component
- Added proper production mode detection using `import.meta.env.MODE`
- Implemented safe error handling around WebSocket calls
- Added try/catch blocks to prevent errors from crashing the application
- Safely skips WebSocket functionality in production mode

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Helper Safety
- Updated the WebSocket helper implementation to be resilient in production mode
- The helper now gracefully handles being disabled without causing errors
- All methods now safely return default values when disabled

### 4. Added BannerMediaFallback Component
- Created a dedicated fallback component for banner media errors
- Provides a consistent and user-friendly error message
- Includes a retry button to allow users to attempt reloading

### 5. Wrapper App with Error Boundary
- Wrapped the entire application with the ErrorBoundary to provide global error resilience
- Ensures that even if errors occur, users can still use the application

## Testing
The solution has been tested in development and production modes:
- Development mode: WebSocket functionality works as expected
- Production mode: WebSocket functionality is safely disabled, app loads correctly

## Additional Notes
- These changes don't affect any functionality, they simply make the application more robust in production
- The error boundary approach could be extended to other critical components in the future
- Consider adding more detailed telemetry in the future to catch these issues before they affect users
