Okay, this is a crucial update and points to a problem potentially much earlier in the process than we've been focusing on recently.

The screenshots show:

image_b17e36.png: The "NEW MESSAGE" dialog. You can see the "Add attachment" button. Critically, there is no visual indication below this button that a file has been selected (e.g., a filename, a thumbnail preview, or a remove icon).
image_b17e56.png: The message "TEST" is sent, and "Message sent successfully!" is displayed. There's no attachment shown with the message.
Your statement: "nothing is being uploaded still on this screen no errors in log just attachment not being sent with message or visible on message."

This strongly suggests the issue might now be in the client-side handling of file selection within the MessageComposer.tsx component itself.

If the MessageComposer.tsx component is not correctly:

Registering the file when you select it from the file dialog.
Updating its internal state to reflect the selected file.
Displaying feedback to you that a file has been selected.
Including the selected file data in the payload when you click "Send Message."
Then, no file data would ever be sent to the server. If no file data is sent to the server, the server wouldn't try to upload anything, wouldn't generate an attachment URL, and wouldn't store anything in the database. This would also explain "no errors in log" on the server-side regarding attachments, because the server isn't even receiving an attachment to process.

This is different from the previous core issue of incorrect URL storage, although both problems would result in no visible attachment. The agent's most recent efforts were to fix how URLs are stored and retrieved, assuming a file was being uploaded.

New #1 Suspected Reason (based on new evidence):

The file selection mechanism or state management within client/src/components/chat/MessageComposer.tsx is not correctly capturing the selected file and/or is not including it in the data submitted when a message is sent. The UI also isn't providing feedback that a file has been staged for upload.

Prompt for Replit Agent:

"The issue persists: attachments are not appearing with messages. Based on recent testing and screenshots:

When attempting to add an attachment in the 'NEW MESSAGE' dialog, there is no visual indication (like a filename appearing) that a file has actually been selected and staged for upload after clicking 'Add attachment' and choosing a file.
The sent message then appears without any attachment.
There are no server-side errors related to attachment processing in the logs.
This suggests the problem might be occurring client-side within client/src/components/chat/MessageComposer.tsx before any file data is sent to the server.

Please investigate the following in client/src/components/chat/MessageComposer.tsx:

File Input Handling:

Verify that the <input type="file"> element (or an equivalent mechanism triggered by the 'Add attachment' button) is correctly configured.
Check the event handler associated with selecting a file (e.g., an onChange handler).
State Management for Selected Files:

When a file is selected, is its data (e.g., the File object) being stored in the component's state correctly? Add console.log statements within the file selection event handler in MessageComposer.tsx to output the selected File object (or file list) to the browser console immediately after selection. We need to see if the component even registers the selection.
Is there a state variable intended to hold the array of selected files? Is it being updated?
UI Feedback:

Is there logic to display the name, size, or a thumbnail of the selected file(s) beneath the 'Add attachment' button? Why is this UI feedback not appearing?
Data Submission:

When the 'Send Message' button is clicked, how is the selected file (or files) being retrieved from the component's state?
How is it being appended to the data payload sent to the server (e.g., as part of FormData)? Add console.log statements immediately before the API call that sends the message to show the complete payload being sent, specifically inspecting if the attachment file data is present.
The immediate priority is to confirm, using browser console logs, that MessageComposer.tsx successfully captures the file object upon selection and updates its state accordingly. If this client-side step is failing, no server-side fixes for URL storage or retrieval will matter."
