 adding a Message Templates feature with smart targeting like “sponsorship expiring within 7 days” is entirely doable — and actually a very practical enhancement to your message system. Here's how it can work:

✅ Feature: Message Templates with Auto-Populated Recipients
🔧 Functional Capabilities
1. Template Selection Dropdown
Add a Template dropdown above the To field:

“Select a template”

“7-Day Sponsorship Renewal Reminder”

“Welcome Message for New Paid Users”

“Badge Holder Upgrade Offer”

“Custom (No Template)”

2. Auto-populate Fields When Template Is Selected
When a template is selected:

Recipients field is auto-filled (e.g. Paid Users expiring in next 7 days)

Subject is set (e.g. Reminder: Renew Your Sponsorship Benefits)

Message body is pre-filled with customizable content

3. Dynamic Recipient Fetching
Backend logic identifies users:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE role = 'paid'
  AND sponsorship_expiration BETWEEN NOW() AND NOW() + INTERVAL 7 DAY;
4. Admin Override
Admins can still adjust recipients, subject, and message content after the template is applied.

✉️ Example Template: "7-Day Sponsorship Renewal Reminder"
📌 Recipients
All users with sponsorship_expiration within the next 7 days.

📌 Subject
Reminder: Renew Your Sponsorship Benefits

📌 Message
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Hi {{first_name}},

We noticed your sponsorship benefits are set to expire on {{sponsorship_expiration}}. 

To maintain your access to exclusive features and support the platform, please renew your sponsorship by visiting your [Account Page](https://example.com/account).

Thank you for being part of our community!

— The Admin Team
(You can dynamically insert user-specific variables like {{first_name}}, {{sponsorship_expiration}}, etc.)

🔐 Access Control
Only admins can view and use templates that target a group.

Regular users still only see "Admin Team" in recipients.

🚀 Implementation Outline
Component	Update Needed
Frontend	Add Template dropdown; preload fields when selected
Backend	Create /templates endpoint and support for query-based recipient resolution
DB	Ensure sponsorship_expiration field is indexed and up to date
Security	Confirm only authorized users can use group-targeted templates

✅ Optional Enhancements
Add Scheduled Send (e.g., send 3 days before expiration).

Save custom templates to a DB table (message_templates) for reuse.

Include preview mode with variable resolution.
