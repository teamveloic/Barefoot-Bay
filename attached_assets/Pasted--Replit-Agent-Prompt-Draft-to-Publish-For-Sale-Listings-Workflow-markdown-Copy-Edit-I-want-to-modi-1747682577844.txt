I want to modify the For Sale listing flow to support **Draft Listings**, **Delayed Payment**, and **Republish Expired Listings**. Follow the steps below to update my existing listing system:

---

## 🧱 BACKEND CHANGES

1. **Listing Status Support**
   - Update the `real_estate_listings` schema to add a new `status` field.
   - Use an enum or string with values: `"DRAFT"`, `"ACTIVE"`, `"EXPIRED"`.
   - Default status should be `"DRAFT"` when a new listing is created.

2. **Create Listing Without Payment**
   - Allow users to submit the `CreateListingForm` without any payment information.
   - Save listing to the database with status `"DRAFT"`.
   - Do not require subscriptionId or expirationDate at creation time.

3. **Publish Listing Endpoint**
   - Add a new API endpoint: `POST /api/listings/:id/publish`.
   - This should:
     - Verify the listing belongs to the authenticated user
     - Trigger the Square payment flow
     - Upon successful payment, set:
       - `status = "ACTIVE"`
       - `expirationDate = now + selected duration (3, 7, or 30 days)`
       - store the subscription/payment metadata

4. **Expiration Handling**
   - Implement a daily job or hook to scan for `ACTIVE` listings where `expirationDate < now()` and update them to `status = "EXPIRED"`.

## 💻 FRONTEND CHANGES

1. **Create Listing Flow**
   - Update the `CreateListingForm` so that it submits the listing immediately as `"DRAFT"` without needing to go through the payment process.
   - After submission, redirect the user to the "My Listings" page with a status indicator of "Draft".

2. **My Listings Enhancements**
   - Group listings by status: `Draft`, `Active`, `Expired`
   - For each listing, show a badge with its status
   - For `Draft` or `Expired` listings, show a **"Publish"** or **"Renew"** button

3. **Publish Button Behavior**
   - When user clicks "Publish" on a `DRAFT` or `EXPIRED` listing:
     - Open a modal to select duration and proceed with payment
     - On success, call the `POST /api/listings/:id/publish` endpoint
     - After publish, show listing in `/for-sale` if `ACTIVE`

## 🔄 LISTING LIFECYCLE LOGIC

Support full lifecycle:
[DRAFT] → Publish & Pay → [ACTIVE] → After Expiry → [EXPIRED]
↑ ↓
Renew & Pay ←–––––––––––––––––––––––––

## 🧪 TESTING

- Creating a listing without payment should show it under "My Listings" as "Draft"
- Published listings should appear in `/for-sale` only if status is `"ACTIVE"`
- Expired listings should disappear from `/for-sale`, but still show in "My Listings"
- Renewing an expired listing should make it active again

Make sure all changes use the existing Drizzle ORM, authentication middleware, and frontend components (`CreateListingForm`, `ListingCard`, `for-sale-page.tsx`, etc
