🔧 Replit Agent Prompt: Fix Vendor URL Slug Generation and Display
🧠 Context
The application manages vendor pages for a community platform. Each vendor page has:

A Title (free text)

A Vendor Category (dropdown)

A URL Slug field (currently editable and improperly generated)

❌ Current Problem
The URL Slug:

Is editable by users (it shouldn't be)

Is auto-generated in the wrong format (e.g., vendors-anchor-and-vapor-barrier-and-vapor-barrier-underhome-armor-anchor-and-vapor-barrier)

Often repeats the category and doesn’t follow the intended URL structure

Is stored with hyphens throughout, instead of separating category and title

✅ Target Behavior
The slug should be auto-generated and non-editable

Slugs should follow this exact structure in the frontend display and backend DB:

css
Copy
Edit
vendors/[category]/[unique-identifier]
The slug should be stored internally using hyphens only within the category or title, like:

cpp
Copy
Edit
vendors-anchor-and-vapor-barrier-underhome-armor-anchor-and-vapor-barrier
No user input should be required or allowed for the slug field.

🧩 Expected Implementation Details
🔁 Slug Generation Logic
Watch the Vendor Category and Title fields.

Slugify both:

Lowercase

Replace spaces with hyphens

Remove special characters

Remove duplication:

If the title begins with the category, strip it out of the title part of the slug.

Format the slug like:

ts
Copy
Edit
vendors-[category-slug]-[title-slug]
✅ Frontend Form Changes
Remove or make the slug field read-only in the form UI.

Auto-generate the slug in a useEffect hook whenever title or category changes.

Use a VendorUrlDisplay preview component to show users the formatted path:

css
Copy
Edit
/vendors/[category]/[unique-identifier]
✅ Backend/Database Behavior
Store the slug with hyphens in the DB.

Never store slashes in the slug field to avoid routing conflicts.

📂 Files to Modify
client/src/pages/admin/manage-vendors.tsx:

useEffect hook for slug generation

Make slug field read-only or remove it

Update <VendorUrlDisplay /> to show correct structure

Optional utility update:

utils/slugify.ts or equivalent

🧪 Testing Criteria
Create a vendor with category: Home Services, title: Dan Hess - Antiques & Estate Sales

Should generate slug: vendors-home-services-dan-hess-antiques-estate-sales

Displayed path should be: /vendors/home-services/dan-hess-antiques-estate-sales

Ensure vendor slugs don’t repeat the category or contain malformed separators.

Validate that users cannot manually modify the slug field.
