# Real Estate Media Object Storage Integration

This document outlines the implementation of the real estate media upload system using Replit Object Storage exclusively.

## Key Components

### 1. Media Upload Handler

- The `handleRealEstateUpload` function now uses `multer.memoryStorage()` instead of disk storage.
- Files are kept in memory and then uploaded directly to Object Storage.
- This prevents any filesystem storage, optimizing for cloud-based deployment.

### 2. Object Storage Middleware

- The `realEstateObjectStorageMiddleware` handles the transfer of in-memory files to Object Storage.
- Each file buffer is processed and uploaded using `uploadRealEstateMediaFromBuffer`.
- Media URLs are properly formatted for access through the storage proxy.

### 3. Storage Integration

- Media files are stored with the prefix `real-estate-media/`.
- Unique filenames are generated using the timestamp + random number pattern.
- Files can be accessed through three URL formats:
  1. Full path: `/api/storage-proxy/REAL_ESTATE/real-estate-media/filename.ext`
  2. Short path: `/api/storage-proxy/REAL_ESTATE/filename.ext`
  3. Direct path: `/api/storage-proxy/direct-realestate/filename.ext`

### 4. API Endpoints

The following endpoints have been updated to use Object Storage:

- `/api/upload/real-estate-media` - Direct upload endpoint
- `/api/listings` - Create listing endpoint
- `/api/listings/:id` - Update listing endpoint
- `/api/listings/bulk-import` - CSV bulk import endpoint

### 5. Test Pages

To verify the functionality of the Object Storage integration, use these test pages:

- `/public/real-estate-upload-test.html` - Tests direct file upload
- `/public/real-estate-listing-test.html` - Tests listing creation with file upload

## Implementation Benefits

1. **No Filesystem Storage** - All media is stored exclusively in Replit Object Storage.
2. **Cross-Environment Compatibility** - Media uploaded in development can be accessed in production.
3. **Simplified Deployment** - No local disk space concerns or directory permissions.
4. **Improved Security** - Uses proxy endpoints for controlled access to media files.
5. **Performance** - Direct buffer-to-storage upload without intermediate filesystem writes.

## Testing

1. Upload sample images through the test pages provided.
2. Verify URLs follow the expected pattern.
3. Confirm images are accessible through the proxy endpoints.
4. Check that no files are written to the local filesystem in the uploads directory.
